>Hi there,
>this is completely work in progress. So nothing special here yet, but once it's done it'll be cool, if not for anyone else then at least for me. Poke around if you like.

##Phases
######While i'm working i go through phases to help myself realise what i did before and where i'm trying to go. These can be found in the /phases folder and are as follows:

1. Phase one: trying to get data to show up and researching data
2. Phase two: Plotting a graph with relevant data
3. Phase three: getting multiple datasets into the graph
4. Phase four: animating the data according to clicks
5. Phase five: styling to make an impression and adding information
6. Phase six: Putting everything together and finishing touches
