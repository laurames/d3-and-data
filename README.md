##Thesis project: Making data accesible: An overview of interac-tive data visualization using D3.js as applied to scientific datasets

>Hi there,
>this is my graduation bachelor thesis project for Metropolia University of Applied Sciences in Media Engineering. The one page application written in D3js, jQuery, Bootstrap is an experiment with visualising data and making it interactive. 


##Phases
######While i'm working i go through phases to help myself realise what i did before and where i'm trying to go. Up until phase 3 can be found in the /phases folder. Otherwise the working pattern has been as follows:

1. Phase one: trying to get data to show up and researching data
2. Phase two: Plotting a graph with relevant data
3. Phase three: getting multiple datasets into the graph
4. Phase four: animating the data according to clicks
5. Phase five: styling to make an impression and adding information
6. Phase six: Putting everything together and finishing touches

##Running the code
######Follow these instructions if you plan on running the code:

1. Clone the repository onto your own computer
2. In your terminal navigate to the project folder 
3. Run "python -m SimpleHTTPServer"
4. View the project in localhost:8000
